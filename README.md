# data_analysis_portfolio
Hello, I'm Dmitry! I have a bachelor's degree in geology, and am also studying for a master's degree in geoecology at the National University of Oil and Gas "Gubkin University." During my studies at the university, I was repeatedly faced with the need to work with various sources of information and analyze large volumes of data. Over time, I realized that it was not interesting to work with data, to find patterns and features in them.

This repository serves as a showcase of my skills as well as a way to track my progress in data analytics related topics.
